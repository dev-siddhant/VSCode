## Usage

You can replace your current VSCode settings and keybindings by copying these files to the appropriate directory:

- On Linux/macOS: `~/.config/Code/User/`
- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\`

Make sure to back up your existing files before replacing them.

Feel free to use and modify these files as needed.
